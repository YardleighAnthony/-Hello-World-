I am a student at Belgium Campus, working towards getting a [Bcom Degree.](https://www.belgiumcampus.ac.za/bachelor-of-computing)

- I love playing the guitar.
- taking part in extra curriculum ativites such as sports and mountain climbing other than being glued to the screen all day.
- I also enjoy drawing and being around animals except for insects.
- I do not like avocados. The story of my life, short and sweet.

I will just be implementing **some basic markdown elements**

- This is a paragraph that has some `variable` inline code

```html
<p> An html tag for paragraphs <p>
```
  
```javascript
  let name = "Yardleigh" //Some javascript
```
